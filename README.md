## Description


While learning Go, I created this repository to store some of the code I wrote while learning the language.  
After studying the book "The Go Programming Language" by Alan A. A. Donovan and Brian W. Kernighan and doing some exercises from the book, ,  
I decided to do 2 exercises that would help me understand the language better.
    1. Get familiar with fiber web framework
    2. Get familiar with hexagonal architecture

Both can be found in the folders `fiber` and `hexa-architecture` respectively.
